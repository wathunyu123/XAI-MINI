  "expert_narrative": "This intraoral photograph shows the anterior teeth in centric occlusion. The overall oral hygiene appears fair, with signs of mild gingival inflammation (gingivitis) characterized by redness and slight swelling along the gum margins, particularly in the mandibular anterior region. There is evidence of slight marginal gingival recession on the lower incisors. The maxillary teeth are well-aligned. The mandibular anterior teeth exhibit minor crowding. Slight incisal attrition (wear) is visible on the edges of the lower incisors. No obvious caries, fractures, or restorations are apparent in this view.",
