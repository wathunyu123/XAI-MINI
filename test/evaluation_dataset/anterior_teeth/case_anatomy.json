  "expert_narrative": "This intraoral photograph displays a full-mouth cosmetic rehabilitation, most likely with porcelain veneers or full ceramic crowns on all visible teeth. The restorations are uniform in color, exhibit a high value (brightness), and are well-aligned, creating an aesthetic smile. The surrounding gingiva appears healthy, pink, and firm, with well-adapted margins around the restorations, indicating good periodontal health and oral hygiene. The teeth are shown in centric occlusion. Note the presence of slight physiological melanin pigmentation on the lower anterior gingiva.",
